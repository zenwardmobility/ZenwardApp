/**
 * DriverShell: DriverHeader (caller-supplied) + DriverContent + fixed
 * DriverBottomNavigation. Mobile-first, large touch targets throughout.
 *
 * The inner column is capped at max-w-md (28rem/448px, confirmed against
 * the compiled CSS — P1-E3-S2B, which fixed a --spacing-* vs --container-*
 * token collision that had silently made max-w-md compute to 16px at the
 * time this was originally written in P1-E3-S2; see
 * docs/reports/P1-E3-S2B-design-token-driver-visual-report.txt) and
 * centered — at the 390/430 primary target widths this is wider than the
 * viewport, so it has no visible effect; at tablet/desktop widths it keeps
 * the Driver surface intentionally compact (work item §5) rather than
 * stretching a mobile-designed single column full-bleed across a wide
 * screen. This is NOT the Operations desktop layout reused at a
 * breakpoint — Driver never gains a sidebar or multi-column composition at
 * any width.
 *
 * At `sm:` and up, a border is added alongside the existing shadow (P1-E3-
 * S2B, visual QA at 768/1024/1440 — docs/design/qa/driver-today/) so the
 * capped column reads as a deliberate panel rather than a plain edge-to-
 * edge rectangle floating on the page background. Matches this project's
 * own established "borders over shadows" panel convention (see Panel.tsx,
 * application-implementation-plan.md "Distinguishing visual
 * characteristics") rather than introducing a new decorative technique —
 * the shadow was already here; the border brings it in line with every
 * other panel in the design system. Full-bleed edge-to-edge at the 390/430
 * primary target widths is unchanged.
