 * (docs/data/read-api.md) — re-deriving that check in TypeScript would
 * duplicate, and risk drifting from, the database's own authoritative
 * current_driver_id() logic (work item §30). A Membership with role=driver
 * but no resolvable Driver row does NOT redirect (redirecting back into
 * /driver's own guard would loop, work item §60) — it returns a
 * discriminated "link-missing" result so the layout can render a safe,
 * non-crashing account-configuration state inline instead.
 *
 * P1-E3-S9 (work item §4, Owner-Operator Mode): an organization_admin or
 * dispatcher who has ALSO linked themselves as a Driver in this same
 * organization (`link_self_as_driver`/`redeem_driver_invite`) may reach
 * /driver/* too — this is a NAVIGATION relaxation only, not a security
 * one. The actual data access this route eventually performs is still
 * gated entirely by `driver_get_profile`/`current_driver_id()` resolving
 * from the real `drivers` table (organization_id + user_id + status —
 * never Membership.role), exactly as before; this guard simply stops
 * redirecting a dual-hat person away before that check ever runs.
 * Operations authorization (Membership.role) is completely untouched —
 * an Operations-role person with NO linked Driver row is redirected to
 * /operations exactly as before, unchanged.
