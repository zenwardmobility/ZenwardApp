 * service role, no presentation JSX. A dedicated module, not a reuse of
 * `todays-operations.ts`: Dispatch needs Driver/Vehicle assignment OPTIONS
 * (never queried by Today's Operations) and excludes terminal-state Trips
 * entirely (Today's Operations is where completed/cancelled/no_show
 * visibility already lives — work item §20).
 *
 * Bounded to the organization's local "today", same as Today's Operations
 * (`organizationDayBoundsUtc`) — the reference's own day navigator implies
 * a day-scoped board, and the center grid is inherently a TODAY time axis;
 * an in-progress Trip whose `scheduled_pickup_at` fell outside today's
 * window has no meaningful place on that axis, unlike Today's Operations'
 * flat Active Trips list (ZD-131), which deliberately has no day bound.
 * This is a genuine architectural difference between a list and a spatial
 * time-grid, not an inconsistency — recorded in decision-register.md.
