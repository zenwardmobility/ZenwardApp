/**
 * Narrow ZW-code → user-facing message mapping for `create_trip` (P1-E3-S7,
 * work item §37) — mirrors `dispatch-errors.ts`/`trip-detail-errors.ts`'s
 * established pattern exactly. Never exposes a ZW code, SQLSTATE, or raw
 * PostgREST error text to an Operations user.
 *
 * `create_trip` itself (20260831120000_controlled_trip_creation.sql) only
 * ever raises 3 distinct codes — ZW001 (no session), ZW002 (not an
 * Organization Admin/Dispatcher for this organization), and ZW006 (every
 * other validation failure: blank/oversized address, invalid Passenger,
 * invalid Facility, invalid/ineligible Request, or bad time ordering, all
 * collapsed into the SAME code by the function itself). This mapping does
 * not invent finer-grained categories the RPC doesn't actually provide —
 * `INVALID_INPUT` below is deliberately one bucket, with a message broad
 * enough to cover every real cause, matching "Use actual create_trip
 * errors" (work item §37) rather than guessing which field was the problem.
 * `SCHEDULE_UNRESOLVABLE` is the one code this module adds on top of the
 * RPC's own contract — for a local-time conversion failure (DST
 * nonexistent/ambiguous, work item §23) caught before the RPC is ever
 * called, never returned by create_trip itself.
