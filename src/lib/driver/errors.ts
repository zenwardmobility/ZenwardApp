/**
 * Stable application-level error vocabulary for Driver lifecycle mutations
 * (P1-E3-S3, work item §21) — mirrors the same pattern as
 * src/lib/auth/errors.ts: never a raw ZW00x code, SQLSTATE, or Postgres/
 * PostgREST message surfaced to a Driver. The 6 Driver transition RPCs
 * only ever produce ZW001/ZW002/ZW003 (docs/data/mutation-api.md's own
 * documented authorization chain for this family — ZW004/ZW005/ZW006 are
 * ops-action-only) — mapped below, plus one generic fallback for anything
 * else (a network failure, an unexpected code) so nothing ever falls
 * through to raw error text.
