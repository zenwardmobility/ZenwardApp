 * Centralized operations sidebar icon mapping. See /docs/design/design-tokens.md

 * ad hoc in page/component code — add them here so the mapping stays the
 * single source of truth for nav iconography.
 *
 * Note: "Trips" was specified as Route in the reference mapping. Phosphor
 * has no icon literally named `Route` — `Path` is the closest official
 * equivalent (a traced line/route glyph) per the "choose the closest
 * official Phosphor equivalent" instruction. Flagged for design review.
