/**
 * The single Server Action backing every Driver lifecycle progression
 * button (P1-E3-S3, work item §42). No service role — runs entirely under
 * the caller's own authenticated session via `createServerSupabaseClient()`,
 * exactly like every other mutation this application performs.
 *
 * Authorization is layered, matching ZD-105's established relationship
 * between this application layer and the database:
 *   1. `requireDriverAccess()` — re-derived fresh on every call (never
 *      trusted from a prior page render) — confirms the caller is still an
 *      active Driver in an active Membership right now (work item §52/§53).
 *   2. The RPC itself — the actual, final authority on whether THIS caller
 *      may act on THIS specific Trip right now (currently active
 *      assignment, correct from-state). This action never attempts to
 *      duplicate that check; it exists only to invoke the RPC under a real
 *      session and translate its result into safe UI state.
 *
 * `rpc` is validated against the fixed 6-name allowlist derived from
 * `DRIVER_NEXT_ACTION` — never passed through as an arbitrary client-
 * supplied function name (trip ID and expected-state values are untrusted
 * form input; the RPC name must be even more tightly constrained, since an
 * unvalidated dynamic RPC name would be a far more dangerous injection
 * surface than a wrong string parameter).

 * re-renders of the Driver's own active-trip view for no visible benefit.
