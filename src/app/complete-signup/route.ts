/**
 * P1-E4-S0A1 §5/§6/§7/§9 — the one authoritative continuation point for
 * every "authenticated, zero Membership yet" arrival, regardless of HOW a
 * real session first came to exist (a manual `/sign-in` submission, or —
 * the actual cloud reproduction this phase fixes — Supabase's own email
 * confirmation link establishing a session directly, never touching the
 * sign-in Server Action at all). `/` routes every such visitor here
 * instead of straight to `/access-unavailable`.
 *
 * A Route Handler, deliberately NOT a Server Component page: an earlier
 * version of this fix put the exact same logic in `page.tsx` and found,
 * via live local testing (not assumed), that a Next.js Server Component's
 * OWN `redirect()` call — issued from a chained client-router navigation,
 * AFTER an internal `await` for the mutating RPC — was silently not
 * followed by the browser, even though the mutation itself succeeded
 * server-side every time (confirmed directly against the database: the
 * Organization/Membership were correctly created; only the client's
 * on-screen URL never advanced past `/complete-signup`, until a hard
 * reload of that same URL then correctly redirected onward). A Route
 * Handler always returns a REAL HTTP redirect response with a `Location`
 * header — the well-trodden path Next.js's own client-side fetch-based
 * navigation is built to follow — instead of an RSC-payload-embedded
 * soft redirect nested inside an already-redirect-triggered render.
 *
 * Order of checks:
 *   1. Already has a Membership? (idempotent re-visit, OR a race with a
 *      concurrent duplicate request to this SAME route — genuinely
 *      observed locally: Next.js's dev-mode navigation can fire two GET
 *      requests for one redirect chain, and the second sees the first's
 *      already-committed org). Deciding "onboarding vs. operations"
 *      purely from "did *this* request create it" is therefore not
 *      robust — instead this checks the resolved organization's own
 *      `business_stage` (still null only for a genuinely brand-new,
 *      never-onboarded org, work item §3's own field) so EITHER request
 *      in such a race correctly lands the person in onboarding, not just
 *      whichever one happened to win the creation itself.
 *   2. A pending Driver invite token in their own account metadata? —
 *      redeem it. Success → /driver. Failure (revoked/stale/foreign) →
 *      /access-unavailable — deliberately NEVER routed to the operator
 *      organization-creation form (§7's own explicit "do not accidentally
 *      route Driver invitees into operator organization creation").
 *   3. Pending operator full name/business name in metadata? — complete
 *      automatically, silently, exactly once. → /onboarding.
 *   4. Nothing traceable at all (the real-world case §9 exists for: an
 *      account created before this fix existed, whose signUp() call
 *      never persisted any pending metadata) — send to the explicit,
 *      user-initiated recovery form at /complete-signup/form. Never a
 *      manual database edit; never silent/automatic.
