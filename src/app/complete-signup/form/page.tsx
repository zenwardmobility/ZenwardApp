/**
 * P1-E4-S0A1 §9 — the explicit, user-initiated recovery form. Reached
 * ONLY via `/complete-signup` (the Route Handler), which already tried
 * every automatic continuation (driver invite redemption, pending
 * operator signup metadata) and found nothing to complete. This page
 * itself performs no mutation and no automatic redirect chain — it is a
 * plain render, avoiding the exact "Server Component redirect after an
 * internal await" pattern that motivated moving the routing logic to a
 * Route Handler in the first place (see complete-signup/route.ts). The
 * one safety check it keeps is a pure, non-mutating re-resolution: if
 * this person already has a Membership (a race, or they navigated back
 * here after already completing), send them on rather than showing a
 * pointless form.
