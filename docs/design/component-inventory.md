# Zenward Platform — Component Inventory

**Work item:** P1-E3-S0 — Stitch UI Ingestion & Implementation Mapping, amended by P1-E3-S2 — Driver Application Shell & Driver Today, P1-E3-S3 — Driver Trips & Active Trip Experience, P1-E3-S4 — Operations Application Shell & Today's Operations, P1-E3-S5 — Dispatch Board, and P1-E3-S6 — Operations Trip Detail (components below actually built/refined)
**Status:** P1-E3-S0 itself was planning/documentation only. P1-E3-S2 implemented Driver Today and the shared Driver shell; P1-E3-S3 implemented Driver Trips, Trip Detail/Active Trip, and Driver History; P1-E3-S4 implemented the real Today's Operations screen and refined the Operations shell; P1-E3-S5 implemented the real Dispatch Board; P1-E3-S6 implemented the real Operations Trip Detail screen — see "Driver components — P1-E3-S2", "Driver components — P1-E3-S3", "Operations components — P1-E3-S4", "Dispatch components — P1-E3-S5", and "Trip Detail components — P1-E3-S6" below.
**Last updated:** 2026-09-01

Reconciles the Stitch references (docs/design/stitch/references/) against the component library that **already exists** in `src/components/` (built during P0-E2-S3/S3A) rather than proposing an inventory from scratch. Confirmed by direct inspection: the existing `TRIP_STATUS_MAP`/`DRIVER_STATUS_MAP` in `TripStatus.tsx`/`DriverStatus.tsx` already anticipate the exact labels seen in these references (`Requested`, `Pending Confirmation`, `Needs Assignment`, `Available`, `On Trip`, `Break`, `Unavailable`) — the primitive layer is well-aligned; this phase's job is identifying the screen/feature-level composition still needed on top of it.

## Existing primitives (confirmed present, not modified)

| Component | Purpose | Screens using it (per this reference batch) |
|---|---|---|
| `OperationsShell`, `OperationsSidebar`, `AppHeader` | Operations desktop chrome | All 4 Operations screens (01, 02, 03, 05) |
| `PageHeader` | Title + description (+ breadcrumb slot) | 02, 05 (breadcrumb variant) |
| `Breadcrumb` | Trail navigation | 02, 05 |
| `Panel` | Standard bordered content grouping | All Operations screens |
| `SummaryStrip` | Metric row (label/value/tone) | 01, 03 |
| `StatusBadge` (+ `TripStatus`, `DriverStatus` label maps) | Semantic status pill | All screens with any status label |
| `DataTable` | Column-defined tabular list | 01 (Needs Attention, Upcoming Trips) |
| `DefinitionList` | Label/value grid | 02 (info strip, Passenger & Trip Information) |
| `AttentionState` | Warning/critical callout | 01 (Needs Attention header), 03, 05 (Needs Attention rail) |
| `EmptyState` | No-data placeholder | 02 (Trip Exceptions "No open exceptions") |
| `Avatar` | User/driver photo | All screens (header avatar), 03 (driver capacity cards) |
| `Button`, `IconButton`, `LinkButton` | Actions | Throughout |
| `Input`, `SearchInput`, `Select`, `Textarea` | Form fields | 05 |
| `DriverTripCard`, `DriverTripRow` | Compact/featured trip card | 06, 07 |
| `DriverPrimaryAction` | Full-width dominant CTA | 04 |
| `DriverRoute` | Two-point pickup→destination indicator | 04, 06, 07 |
| `DriverInstruction` | Inline advisory note | 04, 06 ("Call passenger on arrival") |

## New components needed (Stitch-driven, not yet built)

| Component | Purpose | Screens | Responsive behavior | Design-system dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MetricCard` (vs. `SummaryStrip` item) | 01's summary items are closer to a horizontal stat row than discrete cards — **confirm which pattern before building**; `SummaryStrip` may already suffice. Flagged for design review, not a confirmed new component. | 01, 03 | — | Existing `SummaryStrip` may cover this — verify before adding |
| `TripListTable` (a `DataTable` composition, not a new primitive) | Named column configuration for the two distinct table shapes on 01 (Needs Attention vs. Upcoming Trips have different columns) | 01 | Desktop only | `DataTable` |
| ~~`DispatchAssignmentGrid`~~ | **Built P1-E3-S5** as `AssignmentGrid` — see "Dispatch components" below | 03 | Desktop/tablet only — no mobile equivalent is implied or required | Built without a new generic primitive; composes `Panel`/`EmptyState` |
| ~~`DispatchQueueCard`~~ | **Built P1-E3-S5** inline within `NeedsAssignmentQueue` (no separate card component — one usage, not worth abstracting yet) | 03 | Desktop | Composes `Panel`, `TripStatus`, `Button` |
| ~~`DriverCapacityCard`~~ | **Built P1-E3-S5** inline within `DriverCapacityPanel` | 03 | Desktop | Composes `Avatar`, `StatusBadge` (not `DriverStatus` — see Dispatch components note on why) |
| ~~`TripRouteTimeline`~~ | **Built P1-E3-S6** as `TripRoutePanel` | 02 (Operations variant, richer than `DriverRoute`) | Desktop | Built without a new generic primitive — composes `Panel`; dot-line-dot metaphor matches `DriverRoute`'s own established pattern |
| ~~`TripCurrentStatusCard`~~ | **Built P1-E3-S6** as `CurrentStatusPanel` | 02 | Desktop | Composes `Panel`, `DefinitionList`, `LinkButton` (the assignment-management entry point, work item §18) |
| ~~`TripNoteList`~~ | **Built P1-E3-S6** as `TripNotesPanel` + `AddNoteDialog` | 02 | Desktop (Driver's note surface is simpler — see `DriverInstruction`, already covers the read-only display case) | Write action ("Add Note") is a direct-table INSERT as anticipated, via a real Server Action — no RPC |
| ~~`ExceptionBadge`~~ / exception panel | **Built P1-E3-S6** as `TripExceptionsPanel` | 02, 04 | Both | `EmptyState` covers the empty case; the populated-list case shows real `trip_exceptions` rows. "Report Issue" rendered disabled — deferred (ZD-151) |
| `RequestSourceSelector` | Segmented radio-card group (Passenger/Family-Caregiver/Healthcare Facility/Other) | 05 | Desktop | New — no existing radio-card component |
| `PassengerPicker` | Search/typeahead + selected-passenger chip + "Add New Passenger" | 05 | Desktop | Composes `SearchInput` |
| `ChangeNoticeBadge` | "Pickup updated from X" advisory | 06, 07 | Mobile | New, small — **blocked on the underlying change-tracking gap** (see gap register); component shape can be designed, but has no real data source yet |
| Org switcher (minimal, unstyled) | Multi-org context resolution | Not in any reference | Both | Deferred per route-map §Multi-org UX — build only the minimal functional version when actually needed, not a designed component now |

## Driver components — P1-E3-S2

Reused/refined the existing Driver primitives rather than rebuilding them (work item §7) — only `DriverNextTripCard` is genuinely new:

| Component | Status | Change |
|---|---|---|
| `DriverShell` | Refined (P1-E3-S2, further refined P1-E3-S2B) | Inner column capped at `max-w-md`, centered — keeps the Driver surface compact at tablet/desktop widths (ZD-115). `max-w-md` computed to 16px, not 448px, until P1-E3-S2B fixed a project-wide Tailwind theme-token collision (ZD-117); P1-E3-S2B also added a `sm:` border matching the design system's established panel convention (ZD-118). Real screenshots: `docs/design/qa/driver-today/`. |
| `DriverHeader` | Refined | Added an optional `driverName` identity subtitle (real data, replaces any notion of a fabricated "On Shift" status) and top safe-area-inset padding |
| `DriverLayoutClient` | Refined | Passes `driverName` through; adds a leading avatar (swapped for the existing back-button on a trip-detail route) and a trailing sign-out affordance reusing the existing `signOutAction` |
| `DriverBottomNavigation` | Refined | Added bottom safe-area-inset padding |
| `DriverRoute` | Refined | Added an optional `appointmentLabel` suffix on the Destination line |
| `DriverTripCard` | Refined | Denser row treatment matching the Stitch reference (time+name on one line, single arrow-joined route line, optional appointment caption); prop shape kept stable — the existing `/foundation` showcase call site is unaffected |
| `DriverNextTripCard` | **New** | The featured "Next Trip" card — composes `DriverRoute` + a `LinkButton` "View Trip" CTA. Deliberately carries no Navigate/Call Passenger actions (ZD-114) |
| `DriverTripRow`, `DriverInstruction`, `DriverPrimaryAction` | Unchanged | Not used by Driver Today this phase — `DriverInstruction`'s "Call passenger on arrival" pattern and `DriverPrimaryAction`'s single-CTA rule remain available for the Active Trip screen |

## Driver components — P1-E3-S3

| Component | Status | Change |
|---|---|---|
| `DriverNextTripCard`, `DriverTripCard` | Reused unchanged | Same components Driver Today already built, now also driving the featured/compact rows on Driver Trips — no Trips-specific fork was created |
| `DriverActiveTripLegs` | **New** | The two-leg pickup/drop-off block for Active Trip — extends the existing dot-line-dot metaphor (`DriverRoute`) into a richer, per-leg display with contextual Navigate/Call Passenger actions attached to whichever leg is currently live (`currentLeg()`) |
| `DriverLifecycleAction` | **New** | The one primary progression button — a real `<form>` + Server Action (`useActionState`), matching `SignInForm`'s established pattern. Disables immediately on submit, never optimistically advances state, refreshes authoritative data on both success and error |
| `DriverInstruction` | Reused unchanged | Now actually used — renders each `driver_notes` entry on Active Trip, exactly the pattern this component was originally built for in P1-E3-S2 but had no call site yet |
| `DefinitionList` | Reused unchanged | The Passenger Requirements card (Assistance/Instructions) |

## Operations components — P1-E3-S4

| Component | Status | Change |
|---|---|---|
| `AppHeader` | Refined | Added optional `title`/`description` (a screen's own persistent-chrome title/date, matching the reference's composition — the title lives in the sticky header, not the scrollable `PageHeader` below it) and `avatarName` (real resolved identity), alongside the existing `contextLabel` fallback used by every not-yet-built Operations route. Added a "?" Help icon next to the existing bell — bare icon, no fabricated data, same convention as the bell itself. |
| `OperationsLayoutClient` | Refined | Builds the Overview route's richer header (title/date/search/Export/New-Trip cluster) itself, from data it already has (`organization.organizationTimezone`) plus static content — no new cross-tree state channel introduced merely for one route (see decision-register.md ZD-129). Now resolves a real `user_profiles.display_name` (via the new `getDisplayName()`) instead of passing the raw session email through as a "name". |
| `SummaryStrip` | Refined | Added an optional `inline` layout (single flowing row, dot + bold value + label, matching the reference's compact metric strip) and a per-item `dot` flag — additive, the original stacked value-over-label layout (`src/app/foundation`'s showcase usage, SummaryStrip's only other call site) is unchanged. |
| `todays-operations` query/presentation modules (`src/lib/operations/`) | **New** | `day-bounds.ts` (org-local "today" as a UTC range — the range-query counterpart to `trip-presentation.ts`'s single-instant timezone helpers), `presentation.ts` (Operations-specific status-label/event-label derivations — a distinct module from the Driver one; an Operations Trip can be genuinely unassigned, which a Driver never sees), `todays-operations.ts` (the three real queries, see [todays-operations-data-map.md](../product/todays-operations-data-map.md)). |
| `src/lib/auth/profile.ts` (`getDisplayName`) | **New** | Real `user_profiles.display_name` resolution with an email fallback — used by Operations this phase; available to any future surface needing the same real-identity lookup. |
| `TripStatus`, `DataTable`, `Panel`, `SectionHeader`, `EmptyState`, `StatusBadge` | Reused unchanged | Every label `operationsTripStatusLabel`/the literal `"Needs Assignment"` produces was already anticipated by `TRIP_STATUS_MAP` before this phase's code was written (confirmed at the top of this document) — no new status-badge component needed. |

Full field-level rationale: [todays-operations-data-map.md](../product/todays-operations-data-map.md).

## Dispatch components — P1-E3-S5

| Component | Status | Change |
|---|---|---|
| `Dialog` (`src/components/ui/Dialog.tsx`) | **New shared primitive** | The first Dialog/Modal in the design system — built on the native `<dialog>` element (`showModal()`, native focus trap, ESC via the `close` event) rather than a new UI library (work item §53). Backdrop dimming is one explicit `dialog::backdrop` rule in `globals.css` (native backdrops are transparent by default). Reusable by any future modal need, not Dispatch-specific. |
| `NeedsAssignmentQueue` | **New** | The left-column card queue — real Needs-Assignment Trips only (no Running Late/Pending Confirmation, matching Today's Operations' ZD-130 precedent). Composes `Panel`/`TripStatus`/`Button`, not a new card primitive (single usage). |
| `AssignmentGrid` | **New** | The center "Today's Assignments" time-axis grid — one row per active Driver, Trip blocks positioned by real `scheduled_pickup_at` via `src/lib/operations/dispatch-grid.ts`'s pure positioning math. Click a block to open the reassignment dialog — no drag-and-drop (ZD-138). |
| `DriverCapacityPanel` | **New** | The right-column rail — real `On Trip` badge only (`StatusBadge`, not the existing `DriverStatus` component: `DriverStatus`'s own `DRIVER_STATUS_MAP` still encodes the full illustrative Available/On Trip/Break/Unavailable set from the original Stitch-ingestion mockup pass, which this phase deliberately does NOT build against real data — reusing it here would risk a future edit to that map silently reintroducing a fabricated status through this screen). |
| `AssignmentDialog` | **New** | The one Assign/Reassign form, built on `Dialog` — real `<form>` + Server Action (`useActionState`), mirrors `DriverLifecycleAction`'s established pattern exactly. Mounted only while active (keyed by trip id + mode) so its action state is always fresh. |
| `DispatchBoardClient` | **New** | Client orchestrator — holds only which dialog is open; every other value is server-fetched (work item §40, no `useEffect` fetch-after-mount). |
| `TripStatus`, `Panel`, `EmptyState`, `Avatar`, `Select`, `Textarea`, `Button` | Reused unchanged | No new status-badge or form-field primitive was needed — every label `operationsTripStatusLabel` produces was already anticipated by `TRIP_STATUS_MAP` before this phase. |

Full field-level rationale: [dispatch-board-data-map.md](../product/dispatch-board-data-map.md).

## Trip Detail components — P1-E3-S6

| Component | Status | Change |
|---|---|---|
| `TripRoutePanel` | **New** | Dot-line-dot metaphor (matches `DriverRoute`), richer per-stop detail: time badge, the Trip's own address snapshot, optional Facility annotation, and `trip.instructions` as an inline callout under Pickup. |
| `PassengerInfoPanel` | **New** | Real fields only — Passenger name/phone, Requester (when linked), Assistance Requirements (Trip-level snapshot only, ZD-149). Trip Type/Reference/Companion all omitted (ZD-148, fabricated concepts). |
| `TripInfoStrip` | **New** | The 5-column at-a-glance strip — a bespoke layout, not built on `DefinitionList` (which only supports 1/2 columns) for a genuinely one-off use. |
| `CurrentStatusPanel` | **New** | Right-rail status summary + the assignment-management entry point (a generic link to `/operations/dispatch`, labeled "Assign Driver"/"Manage Assignment" — work item §18, no second assignment mutation implementation). |
| `TripExceptionsPanel` | **New** | Real open `trip_exceptions` rows; "Report Issue" rendered disabled (ZD-151, mirrors the Driver-side ZD-125 deferral). |
| `TripNotesPanel` + `AddNoteDialog` | **New** | Real `trip_notes` display (both visibilities) + a real, working "Add Note" — a direct RLS-protected INSERT via a Server Action, not an RPC. Author identity deliberately not resolved (matches Today's Operations' Activity Log precedent). |
| `CancelTripDialog`, `NoShowDialog` | **New** | Built on the shared `Dialog` primitive (P1-E3-S5), mirroring `AssignmentDialog`'s established Server-Action pattern exactly — real `cancel_trip`/`record_no_show` RPCs, explicit reason required, deliberate confirm click. |
| `TripDetailActionBar` | **New** | Client orchestrator for which dialog is open + the action button cluster — direct labeled buttons instead of a "More" overflow menu (ZD-147, no dropdown-menu primitive exists yet). |
| `TripStatus`, `Panel`, `DefinitionList`, `EmptyState`, `StatusBadge`, `Dialog`, `Select`, `Textarea`, `Button` | Reused unchanged | No new status-badge, form-field, or dialog primitive was needed. |

Full field-level rationale: [operations-trip-detail-data-map.md](../product/operations-trip-detail-data-map.md).

## New Trip components — P1-E3-S7

| Component | Status | Change |
|---|---|---|
| `FormSection` | **New** | The card-panel + icon + bold-title header pattern the reference establishes for "Request Source"/"Passenger", extended here to the Schedule/Pickup/Destination/Instructions & Assistance sections the reference's own composition doesn't show (see the data map). |
| `NewTripForm` | **New** | The one controlled client orchestrator — real `<form>` + Server Action (`useActionState`), holds Facility-select-populates-address and Request-Import cross-field state, plus the double-submit guard (create_trip is non-idempotent, ZD-102). |
| `AddPassengerDialog` | **New** | Built on the shared `Dialog` primitive, mirrors `AddNoteDialog`'s real-RLS-INSERT pattern exactly — never `router.refresh()`s (would risk clearing an in-progress form); hands the created Passenger back to the parent form directly. |
| `AttentionState` (`src/components/ui/AttentionState.tsx`) | **Extended** | Added an `info` level (calm, non-alarming — for "you'll assign a driver after creating this trip") using the existing `--color-info-*` tokens, already defined in `globals.css` for `StatusBadge`'s `informational` category but unused by `AttentionState` until now. `warning`/`critical` unchanged. |
| `Select` (`src/components/ui/Select.tsx`) | **Fixed (real bug)** | Found via this phase's own real browser testing: `Select` unconditionally set `defaultValue` whenever a `placeholder` was given, even when the caller also passed a controlled `value` — React's "must be either controlled or uncontrolled" warning, the first genuinely NEW usage pattern (a controlled `Select` with a placeholder) to exercise this latent defect. Fixed to only set `defaultValue` when the caller hasn't passed `value` — benefits any future controlled-`Select`-with-placeholder usage. |
| `Dialog`, `Select`, `Input`, `Textarea`, `Button`, `LinkButton`, `Panel` | Reused unchanged | No new form-field primitive was needed beyond the `Select` fix above. |

Full field-level rationale: [new-trip-data-map.md](../product/new-trip-data-map.md).

## Driver location + live Dispatch components — P1-E3-S7A

| Component | Status | Change |
|---|---|---|
| `DriverLocationTracker` | **New** | Isolated geolocation side effects (permission state, `watchPosition` lifecycle, 20s submission throttle, cleanup, status display) — kept out of the Active Trip page component itself (work item §46). Found and fixed a real bug during this phase's own testing: an initial version treated every `watchPosition` error (including ordinary transient `POSITION_UNAVAILABLE`/`TIMEOUT` blips) as fatal and silently killed tracking for the rest of the Trip after the first one — corrected to only stop on `PERMISSION_DENIED`. |
| `DispatchLiveRefresh` | **New** | Realtime was evaluated and deliberately deferred this phase (could not be proven tenant-safe with real adversarial tests in the time available — "security beats animation"). Renders nothing; triggers `router.refresh()` every 20s, reusing the Dispatch Board's own already-proven re-fetch mechanism rather than a new data path. |
| `AssignmentGrid` | **Extended** | Each driver row now shows a real freshness indicator + external map link (`MapPin` icon, compact "Just now"/"N min ago"/"Stale" text, full wording in the `title` tooltip) for whichever of that Driver's Trips is currently in the tracking window — assignment-scoped (work item §51), never a stale former Driver's last-known position. |
| `AttentionState` `info` level | Reused (extended in P1-E3-S7) | No further change this phase. |

Full field-level rationale: [driver-location-architecture.md](../product/driver-location-architecture.md), [live-dispatch-location-data-map.md](../product/live-dispatch-location-data-map.md).

## Explicitly not building generically

Per work item §35's own caution: no generic "Card" or "ListItem" abstraction is proposed merely for reuse. `DispatchQueueCard`, `DriverCapacityCard`, `TripRouteTimeline`, etc. are each named for what they specifically show, following the existing codebase's own pattern (`DriverTripCard`, not a generic `Card`).
