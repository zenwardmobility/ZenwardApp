# Zenward Platform — Controlled Mutation API

**Work item:** P1-E2-S2 — Controlled Mutation & Transaction Boundary, amended by P1-E3-S0A — Controlled Internal Trip Creation Boundary (`create_trip`, ZD-101/ZD-102)
**Status:** Implemented and verified against a running local Supabase/Postgres instance. Not a syntax-only claim — 204 SQL test assertions, a genuine two-process concurrency test, and 18 real PostgREST/GoTrue HTTP checks all pass.
**Last updated:** 2026-08-31

This document is the contract for every mutation RPC added in P1-E2-S2. It complements [mutation-authorization.md](../security/mutation-authorization.md) (the authorization architecture and reasoning) and [rls-model.md](../security/rls-model.md) (the underlying table/column privilege posture, unchanged except where noted below).

## How to call these

Every function below is a normal Supabase/PostgREST RPC: `POST /rest/v1/rpc/<function_name>` with a JSON body of named parameters, `Authorization: Bearer <user access token>`, and the project `apikey`. None of them accept or require a service-role key — they run under the caller's own authenticated session, elevating internally via `SECURITY DEFINER` only for the specific writes each one is documented to make.

## Error contract (ZD-085)

Every rejection is a Postgres exception with a custom SQLSTATE, surfaced by PostgREST as `body.code` in the JSON error response (confirmed by direct HTTP test — see `docs/reports/P1-E2-S2-completion-report.txt`). **Branch on `code`, never on the message text.**

| Code | Meaning | Typical HTTP status via PostgREST |
|---|---|---|
| `ZW001` | `unauthorized` — caller has a real, visible relationship to the resource but lacks the specific permission for this action | 400 (PostgREST does not remap custom codes to a specific 4xx by default; the code field is authoritative) |
| `ZW002` | `not_found` — resource does not exist, OR the caller has no legitimate visibility into it under RLS. Cross-tenant and nonexistent are deliberately indistinguishable (no existence oracle) | 400 |
| `ZW003` | `stale_state` — the Trip's actual current state does not match what this call requires (either the caller's `expected_current_state` or the function's own fixed from-state) | 400 |
| `ZW004` | `illegal_transition` — the requested change is not a legal edge from the Trip's current state, independent of any `expected_current_state` mismatch (e.g. cancelling an already-`completed` Trip, or (re)assigning past `arrived_at_pickup`) | 400 |
| `ZW005` | `assignment_conflict` — a `trip_assignments` precondition failed: an active assignment already exists with a different driver/vehicle when calling `assign_trip`; no active assignment exists when calling `reassign_trip`; OR (P1-E3-S5A) `reassign_trip`'s `p_expected_assignment_id` no longer matches the currently-active assignment — the Dispatcher's decision is based on a since-superseded assignment | 400 |
| `ZW006` | `invalid_input` — malformed or missing parameter (blank/oversized reason, unknown or inactive driver/vehicle, null required id) | 400 |

Every anon (unauthenticated) call is rejected before any of this logic runs — no function below grants `EXECUTE` to `anon` or `PUBLIC`, so an anonymous call fails at the privilege layer with a standard Postgres `insufficient_privilege` (42501), not one of the six codes above.

## Idempotency (ZD-090, amended by ZD-093)

Every lifecycle mutation RPC returns a `changed: boolean` field. `changed: false` means the call was a safe no-op — the requested end state already held, nothing was written, and no duplicate `trip_events`/`audit_events` row was created. Callers should treat a `changed: false` response as success, not as an error to retry differently. See ZD-090 for the exact precedence rule between the idempotent-no-op check and the active-assignment check.

**For the 6 Driver transition RPCs specifically (ZD-093):** the target-state-already-holds no-op is granted only to the Driver who can be verified, via the trusted `trip_events.actor_user_id` history, to have actually performed that exact transition — never merely because the caller has *some* historical relationship to the Trip. A formerly-assigned Driver retrying an action a *different* Driver performed after a reassignment is denied (`ZW001`), not handed a false success. See [mutation-authorization.md](../security/mutation-authorization.md) "Idempotent no-op is actor-scoped, not relationship-scoped" and `docs/reports/P1-E2-S2A-idempotent-authorization-audit.txt`.

## Return types

Two composite types (`supabase/migrations/20260831100100_mutation_result_types.sql`), serialized by PostgREST as plain JSON objects:

```
trip_transition_result: { trip_id, previous_state, current_state, changed }
trip_assignment_result: { trip_id, assignment_id, driver_id, vehicle_id, changed }
trip_creation_result:   { trip_id, organization_id, state, created }
```

---

## Trip creation

### `create_trip(p_organization_id uuid, p_passenger_id uuid, p_pickup_description text, p_destination_description text, p_scheduled_pickup_at timestamptz default null, p_appointment_at timestamptz default null, p_pickup_facility_id uuid default null, p_destination_facility_id uuid default null, p_assistance_notes text default null, p_instructions text default null, p_request_id uuid default null) returns trip_creation_result`

Organization Admin / Dispatcher only (`has_org_role`, same `ZW002` convention as every other ops function — a Driver, an inactive Membership, and a foreign organization all produce the identical error). The sole controlled path to create a Trip — **`state` is never a parameter**, hard-coded `'scheduled'` internally, so a caller has no mechanism to request any other initial state (ZD-102).

**Validates, all `ZW006 invalid_input` on failure (no existence oracle — nonexistent and foreign-tenant are indistinguishable):**
- `pickup_description`/`destination_description`: required, non-blank, ≤2000 chars each
- if both timestamps are given, `appointment_at >= scheduled_pickup_at`
- `passenger_id`: required; must exist, same organization, `status='active'`
- `pickup_facility_id`/`destination_facility_id` (optional): if given, must exist, same organization, `status='active'`
- `request_id` (optional): if given, must exist, same organization, and be `state` `pending` or `accepted` (a `declined`/`cancelled` request is not usable)

**Request lifecycle side effect:** when `request_id` is supplied and that request is currently `pending`, it is atomically transitioned to `accepted` in the same transaction — the system-driven transition the `transportation_requests` table's own original comment anticipated but nothing implemented until this phase. An already-`accepted` request (e.g. creating a return-leg Trip) is left untouched — Request→Trip is never assumed 1:1.

**Does not assign a Driver/Vehicle.** Trip creation and assignment remain separate commands by design (ZD-102) — call `assign_trip` afterward.

**Writes:** `trips` INSERT (`state='scheduled'`, all terminal timestamps `NULL`); the conditional `transportation_requests` UPDATE above; one `trip_events` row (`request_converted_to_trip` if `request_id` was supplied, `trip_scheduled` otherwise — both already-existing values in the event-type vocabulary, no schema change needed); one `audit_events` row (`trip_created`, minimal metadata — `state`/`passenger_id`/`request_id` only, no Passenger PII, no free-text address).

**Idempotency:** none. `create_trip` is deliberately non-idempotent (ZD-102) — two legitimate Trips can share the same passenger/time/address, so no duplicate-detection heuristic is attempted. `created` in the response is always `true`; application code is responsible for preventing accidental double-submission (e.g. disabling the submit button while the request is in flight).

**Example:**
```
POST /rest/v1/rpc/create_trip
{ "p_organization_id": "...", "p_passenger_id": "...", "p_pickup_description": "...", "p_destination_description": "..." }
→ 200 { "trip_id": "...", "organization_id": "...", "state": "scheduled", "created": true }
```

### Direct table access is retired (ZD-101)

As of this phase, `authenticated` has **no** direct INSERT grant on `trips` at all — `create_trip` is the only creation path. The existing planning-column UPDATE grant (from P1-E2-S1) and SELECT are completely unchanged.

---

## Driver lifecycle transitions

Six narrow functions, one per legal edge (lifecycle-model.md §C). Each takes `(p_trip_id uuid, p_expected_current_state text)` — never a target-state parameter; the edge is fixed by which function is called. Driver-only: requires the caller to resolve (via `current_driver_id`) to a Driver row holding a **currently active** `trip_assignments` row on this specific Trip (stricter than `is_driver_assigned_to_trip`'s read-scope "ever assigned" check).

| Function | Legal from → to | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `driver_start_to_pickup` | `scheduled` → `en_route_to_pickup` | |
| `driver_arrive_at_pickup` | `en_route_to_pickup` → `arrived_at_pickup` | |
| `driver_mark_passenger_onboard` | `arrived_at_pickup` → `passenger_onboard` | |
| `driver_start_to_destination` | `passenger_onboard` → `en_route_to_destination` | |
| `driver_arrive_at_destination` | `en_route_to_destination` → `arrived_at_destination` | |
| `driver_complete_trip` | `arrived_at_destination` → `completed` | Also closes the active `trip_assignments` row (`ended_at`, `end_reason='trip_completed'`) in the same transaction — a Driver is never left "actively assigned" to a completed Trip. Sets `trips.completed_at`. |

**Authorization chain:** `auth.uid()` not null → Trip exists (`ZW002` if not) → caller has *ever* had an assignment on this Trip (`is_driver_assigned_to_trip`, `ZW002` if not — mirrors their RLS read visibility) → Trip already at this function's target state? → return idempotent no-op → caller has a *currently active* assignment on this Trip (`ZW001` if not — they can see it, they just can't act on it, e.g. it was reassigned away or already completed) → Trip's actual state matches this function's required from-state, and matches `expected_current_state` if supplied (`ZW003` if not) → mutate.

**Writes:** `trips.state` (+ `completed_at` for the terminal one); one `trip_events` row (`event_type` = the target state name, or `trip_completed`). No `audit_events` row (ZD-087 — routine progress, not a responsibility/terminal-disposition change, except completion which *is* covered by the assignment-closure logic but still intentionally gets no separate AuditEvent — see ZD-087's rationale).

**Example:**
```
POST /rest/v1/rpc/driver_arrive_at_pickup
{ "p_trip_id": "...", "p_expected_current_state": "en_route_to_pickup" }
→ 200 { "trip_id": "...", "previous_state": "en_route_to_pickup", "current_state": "arrived_at_pickup", "changed": true }
```

---

## Operations lifecycle actions

Organization Admin / Dispatcher only (`has_org_role(organization_id, ['organization_admin','dispatcher'])`; failure of this check is uniformly `ZW002 not_found` — see [mutation-authorization.md](../security/mutation-authorization.md) for why).

### `cancel_trip(p_trip_id uuid, p_reason text)`

Legal from any non-terminal state → `cancelled`. `p_reason` required, 1–500 characters after trimming (`ZW006` if blank/oversized). Idempotent no-op if already `cancelled`. `ZW004` if the Trip already reached a *different* terminal state (`completed`/`no_show` cannot be cancelled). Closes any active `trip_assignments` row as part of the same transaction. Sets `trips.cancelled_at`, `trips.cancellation_reason`.

**Writes:** `trips.state`/`cancelled_at`/`cancellation_reason`; one `trip_events` row (`trip_cancelled`, `metadata.reason`); one `audit_events` row (`trip_cancelled`, `reason`, before/after state).

### `record_no_show(p_trip_id uuid, p_reason text)`

Legal only from `en_route_to_pickup` or `arrived_at_pickup` → `no_show` (lifecycle-model.md §J). `p_reason` required, same validation as `cancel_trip`. Idempotent no-op if already `no_show`. `ZW004` from any other state. Closes any active `trip_assignments` row. Sets `trips.no_show_at`. **`trips` has no `no_show_reason` column** — the reason lives in `trip_events.metadata` and `audit_events.reason` only; no schema field was added speculatively for this.

**Writes:** `trips.state`/`no_show_at`; one `trip_events` row (`no_show_recorded`, `metadata.reason`); one `audit_events` row (`no_show_recorded`, `reason`, before/after state).

---

## Assignment

Organization Admin / Dispatcher only. Both require the Trip to be in an assignment-eligible state: `scheduled`, `en_route_to_pickup`, or `arrived_at_pickup` (`ZW004` otherwise — ZD-088). Driver/vehicle must belong to the *same* `organization_id` and have `status='active'` (`ZW006` otherwise — this is an application-level check; the composite FK on `trip_assignments` is the schema-level backstop for the organization match, already covered by RLS tests W/X).

### `assign_trip(p_trip_id uuid, p_driver_id uuid, p_vehicle_id uuid default null)`

Requires **no existing active** `trip_assignments` row on the Trip.
- No existing row → validates driver/vehicle → creates the row.
- An existing row with the **same** driver+vehicle → idempotent no-op (`changed: false`), no write.
- An existing row with a **different** driver or vehicle → `ZW005 assignment_conflict` — use `reassign_trip` instead. `assign_trip` never silently overwrites.

**Writes (on real creation):** `trip_assignments` INSERT; one `trip_events` row (`driver_assigned`, `metadata.driver_id`/`vehicle_id`); one `audit_events` row (`driver_assigned`).

### `reassign_trip(p_trip_id uuid, p_driver_id uuid, p_vehicle_id uuid default null, p_reason text default null, p_expected_assignment_id uuid default null)`

Requires an **existing active** `trip_assignments` row (`ZW005` if none — use `assign_trip` instead). As of **P1-E3-S5B**, the check order is:
1. **`p_expected_assignment_id` must equal the active assignment's own `id`** (checked FIRST, under the same row lock) → `ZW005 assignment_conflict` on ANY mismatch — including a `null`/omitted value (no way to skip this by omitting the parameter), and including the case where the requested driver/vehicle happen to already equal the CURRENT assignment's own driver/vehicle. A stale expected assignment is always rejected; it is never silently treated as a no-op just because the request happens to coincide with reality.
2. Only once `p_expected_assignment_id` is confirmed current: requested driver+vehicle exactly match the (now-confirmed-current) active assignment → idempotent no-op (`changed: false`), no write.
3. Otherwise (a real change, with a confirmed-current expected id) → validates the new driver/vehicle → closes the old row (`ended_at`, `end_reason` = `p_reason` or `'reassigned'`) → inserts a new active row. Never edits `driver_id`/`vehicle_id` in place on the existing row (ZD-051 — reassignment is always close-and-insert).

`p_reason` is optional context, not a precondition — a reassignment with no reason given is legal (unlike `cancel_trip`/`record_no_show`, where a reason is required).

**`p_expected_assignment_id` (optimistic-concurrency precondition, P1-E3-S5A/ZD-145, ordering corrected P1-E3-S5B/ZD-146):** added after P1-E3-S5's own live-application testing showed a real, if transactionally-safe, gap: without it, a Dispatcher whose form was based on a since-superseded assignment could silently overwrite a different Dispatcher's newer decision. The caller (the Dispatch UI) always supplies the `trip_assignments.id` it loaded — never shown to the Dispatcher, purely a hidden precondition value.

P1-E3-S5A's original implementation checked the idempotent driver/vehicle match BEFORE `p_expected_assignment_id` — this let a stale expected id slip through as a silent success whenever the request happened to already match the CURRENT (not the caller's expected) assignment. P1-E3-S5B corrected the order: `p_expected_assignment_id` is now the FIRST thing checked once an active assignment is confirmed to exist, before anything else, including the idempotent-match check. **This means a genuine caller-side retry (e.g. a dropped HTTP response) that still carries the pre-call expected id will now also be rejected as `assignment_conflict`, even though it is the caller's own prior change** — a deliberate, explicit product decision (P1-E3-S5B): staleness is staleness, regardless of who caused the current state or why the caller's own expectation is out of date. This is intentionally narrower than the general `p_expected_current_state` retry-safety guarantee the `driver_*` transition RPCs provide (ZD-093, a different mechanism checking Trip *state*, not an assignment *id* — unaffected by this change). In practice the Dispatch UI always re-fetches a fresh expected id on every dialog open, so this narrower guarantee has little real-world cost for this specific application.

**Writes (on real reassignment):** `trip_assignments` UPDATE (close old) + INSERT (new); one `trip_events` row (`driver_reassigned`, `metadata` with previous and new driver/vehicle); one `audit_events` row (`driver_reassigned`, `reason`, before/after assignment).

### Direct table access is retired (ZD-092)

As of this phase, `authenticated` has **no** direct INSERT/UPDATE grant on `trip_assignments` at all — `assign_trip`/`reassign_trip` are the only mutation path. SELECT (both existing policies) is unchanged.

---

## Driver location (P1-E3-S7A)

### `driver_record_location(p_trip_id uuid, p_latitude double precision, p_longitude double precision, p_accuracy_meters double precision default null) returns driver_location_result`

Driver-only. The sole controlled path to record a location update — no direct INSERT grant exists on `driver_location_updates` at all (matches `trip_events`' own zero-grant precedent). Authorization chain, mirroring `_driver_execute_trip_transition`'s established pattern:

1. `auth.uid()` non-null → else `ZW001`.
2. Trip exists → else `ZW002`.
3. `is_driver_assigned_to_trip()` (ever assigned, read-scope) → else `ZW002` (no existence oracle — foreign-org and nonexistent are indistinguishable).
4. `_lock_driver_active_assignment()` — a CURRENTLY active assignment for this Driver on this Trip → else `ZW001` (covers reassignment revocation — a former Driver's next call fails here, same-session).
5. `trips.state` is one of the 5 eligible tracking-window states (`en_route_to_pickup` through `arrived_at_destination`) → else `ZW004` (covers both pre-dispatch `scheduled` and every terminal state).
6. Coordinates valid (`latitude` [-90,90], `longitude` [-180,180], `accuracy_meters >= 0` if given) → else `ZW006`.

`recorded_at` is always the server's own `now()` — no client-supplied timestamp parameter exists. Every write also carries `assignment_id`, tying the row to the exact assignment in force at write time (never merely "this driver, this trip") — see [driver-location-architecture.md](../product/driver-location-architecture.md) for the full rationale, including why `current_driver_id()`'s own existing inactive-Membership/inactive-Driver correction (ZD-100) is inherited here with zero new code.

**Writes:** one `driver_location_updates` INSERT. No `trip_events`/`audit_events` row — a routine, high-frequency operational signal, not a lifecycle transition or an administrative action (distinct from every other mutation family in this document).

### Operations read path

Not an RPC — Operations reads `driver_location_updates` directly via a plain RLS SELECT policy (`driver_location_updates_select_org_operations`, `has_org_role(organization_id, ['organization_admin', 'dispatcher'])`), the same convention every other Operations-read table already uses. See [live-dispatch-location-data-map.md](../product/live-dispatch-location-data-map.md).

---

## Trip exceptions (P1-E3-S8)

Both functions returns `trip_exception_result` (shared, mirrors `driver_location_result`'s own precedent of one shape for a related pair).

### `report_trip_exception(p_trip_id uuid, p_exception_type text default null, p_description text default null)`

Callable by Organization Admin/Dispatcher (any Trip in their org) OR the Trip's own **currently**-assigned Driver. **As of P1-E3-S8A**, the Driver check is `_lock_driver_active_assignment` (the same WRITE-scope, active-assignment-only primitive `driver_record_location` uses) — tightened from the original `is_driver_assigned_to_trip` READ-scope "ever assigned" check, which would have let a reassigned-away or post-terminal Driver keep reporting. A Driver who is reassigned away, or whose Trip reaches a terminal state, is denied immediately in the same session — no separate terminal-state branch is needed, since every terminal transition (`driver_complete_trip`/`cancel_trip`/`record_no_show`) already closes the active assignment in the same transaction (see `mutation-authorization.md`'s own S8A section for the full reasoning, including why a separate check would either be dead code or an existence-oracle leak). Always forces `created_by = auth.uid()` and `status = 'open'`. `p_description`, if given, must be non-blank and ≤2000 chars (`ZW006` otherwise) — otherwise both parameters are genuinely optional, matching the column's own real nullability.

**Writes:** one `trip_exceptions` INSERT; one `trip_events` row (`exception_flagged`, `metadata.exception_id`). No `audit_events` row (does not materially change Trip responsibility or reach a terminal disposition — same test ZD-087 already established, matching `trip_notes`' identical precedent).

### `resolve_trip_exception(p_exception_id uuid, p_resolution_note text default null)`

Organization Admin/Dispatcher only — Driver never resolves (matches the schema's own original comment: "only Dispatcher/Organization Admin resolve — Driver never during MVP"). `ZW002` if the exception doesn't exist or the caller has no org role over it (no existence oracle). **Idempotent no-op** if already resolved: returns `changed: false` and the REAL, already-persisted resolution (whoever resolved it first) — a stale/duplicate resolve attempt's own `p_resolution_note` is never applied, deliberately different from `reassign_trip`'s fail-closed staleness contract (P1-E3-S5B) — see that function's own comment for the reasoning (two resolutions of the same exception never disagree about the operationally relevant fact, unlike a reassignment's driver/vehicle choice). Never deletes the row — full history preserved.

**Writes (on a real resolve only):** `trip_exceptions.status`/`resolved_by`/`resolved_at`/`resolution_note` UPDATE; one `trip_events` row (`exception_resolved`). No `audit_events` row (same reasoning as above). No write of any kind on the idempotent no-op path.

### Direct table access — retired (P1-E3-S8A)

`report_trip_exception`/`resolve_trip_exception` are now the ONLY way any normal actor writes `trip_exceptions`. The three pre-existing direct RLS INSERT/UPDATE policies (`trip_exceptions_insert_operations`, `trip_exceptions_insert_assigned_driver`, `trip_exceptions_update_operations`) are dropped, and `INSERT`/`UPDATE` are revoked from `authenticated` on the table entirely (`supabase/migrations/20260902160000_exception_mutation_boundary_hardening.sql`) — the same treatment `trips` (ZD-101) and `trip_assignments` (ZD-092) already received once their own controlled RPCs existed. DELETE was never granted to any client role. Proven directly, not merely argued: `supabase/tests/exception_mutation_boundary_tests.sql` covers direct INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE denial, forged `created_by`, forged pre-resolved `status`, reopening a resolved row, and historical-field rewriting, for both Operations and Driver actors, same-org and foreign-org. SELECT is completely unaffected — both read policies remain exactly as they were.

---

## Locking, atomicity, and concurrency

- **Lock order (ZD-086):** every function locks `trips` first, then the active `trip_assignments` row if relevant — never the reverse. This is what makes concurrent calls deadlock-free by construction.
- **Atomicity:** every function is a single PL/pgSQL function with no internal exception handler around its own writes — an error anywhere inside it (including one forced by an external trigger, as proven in `mutation_atomicity_tests.sql`) rolls back every write that function made, with nothing partial ever persisted.
- **Concurrency:** `mutation_concurrency_test.sh` proves (by wall-clock timing across two real OS processes, not by inspecting final state alone) that a second `assign_trip` call genuinely blocks on the first's row lock and, once unblocked, correctly detects the now-existing assignment rather than racing past it into a double-booking. The partial unique index `trip_assignments_one_active_per_trip` remains the schema-level backstop underneath this (already covered by RLS test Y).
