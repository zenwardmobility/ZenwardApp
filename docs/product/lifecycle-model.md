# Zenward Mobility — Transportation Lifecycle, State & Transition Model

**Work item:** P1-E1-S2 — Transportation Lifecycle, State & Transition Model
**Phase:** P1 — Core Product Architecture
**Status:** Draft, pending review — Lifecycle Security Gate: READY (see end of document)
**Last updated:** 2026-08-30

This document defines lifecycle semantics on top of the entities confirmed in [domain-model.md](./domain-model.md). **No tables, enums, migrations, RLS policies, RPC functions, or state transitions are implemented here.** This is the state model the schema will encode.

---

## A. Lifecycle overview

Zenward does not have one status field. It has **five separate lifecycle concepts**, each owned by a different entity, none of which may be used to stand in for another:

1. **TransportationRequest lifecycle** — has this intent been reviewed and acted on?
2. **Trip lifecycle** — where is this specific movement, operationally, right now?
3. **TripAssignment lifecycle** — who is currently assigned, and what's the history of who was?
4. **TripException lifecycle** — is something outside normal status open or resolved?
5. **TripEvent history** — not a lifecycle with its own states at all; the append-only record of everything the other four did over time.

A great deal of what looks like "status" in the UI references is not a new lifecycle state on any entity — it's a **derived condition**, computed by combining two entities' real state (e.g., "Needs Assignment" is just "Trip is scheduled and no TripAssignment is active," not a value stored anywhere). Section K maps every UI label seen in prior references to exactly one of: TransportationRequest, Trip, TripAssignment, TripException, driver availability (a separate, not-yet-designed concept), or derived presentation — never more than one, and never invented as a new stored field just because a screen needed a word for it.

## B. TransportationRequest state model

**States:** `pending` → `accepted` | `declined` | `cancelled`

| State | Meaning | Terminal? |
|---|---|---|
| `pending` | Submitted (via public intake or internal entry), awaiting operations action. No distinct "under review" state — nothing behaviorally different happens between "just submitted" and "someone is looking at it" until an outcome is recorded, so a second state would track nothing real. | No |
| `accepted` | At least one Trip has been created from this request. | Yes, for the request's own lifecycle (see below) |
| `declined` | Operations reviewed and will not fulfill it. | Yes |
| `cancelled` | Withdrawn before fulfillment. | Yes |

- **`pending → accepted` is system-driven, not a discretionary click.** It happens automatically, in the same transaction as the first Trip created from this request — "accepted" *means* "converted," nothing more and nothing less. There is no separate manual "mark as accepted" action independent of creating a Trip.
- **A request can create zero, one, or many Trips.** Reaching `accepted` does not prevent more Trips from being created later against the same request (e.g., adding a return leg after the outbound is already running) — the request simply stays `accepted`; no further request-level state transition happens as a result.
- **Child Trip outcomes never write back onto Request.state.** If every Trip created from an `accepted` request is later cancelled, the request does not revert to `pending` or move to any new state — that would be exactly the "one entity's status representing another's lifecycle" mistake this document exists to prevent. The request's own history (§F) remains an honest record of what was asked for and when it was converted, independent of what later happened operationally.
- **Terminal states:** `declined` and `cancelled` are terminal — no further transition. `accepted` is terminal *for the request's own state field* (no other value follows it), even though the request continues to be a live reference point for its child Trips indefinitely.
- **Who may transition:**
  - `pending → accepted`: system (triggered by the trusted Trip-creation path used by operations staff).
  - `pending → declined`: Dispatcher, Organization Admin.
  - `pending → cancelled`: Dispatcher, Organization Admin.
- **Can the public requester cancel before review?** Not at MVP. No requester self-service capability is approved (per product-definition.md and the explicit instruction not to build one here). A requester wanting to withdraw a request does so through whatever channel operations currently uses (phone, etc.), and a staff member performs the `cancelled` transition — the request record itself does not grant the original submitter any direct mutation right.

## C. Trip state model

**A Trip can exist with Driver = Unassigned and Vehicle = Unassigned.** Assignment presence is never part of what makes a Trip "exist" or valid — see §D.

**Canonical states (9), unambiguous by construction:**

```
scheduled
  → en_route_to_pickup
    → arrived_at_pickup
      → passenger_onboard
        → en_route_to_destination
          → arrived_at_destination
            → completed

(from most non-terminal states) → cancelled
(from en_route_to_pickup or arrived_at_pickup) → no_show
```

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `scheduled` | Trip exists with the minimum required data (passenger, pickup, destination, scheduled time). Driver/vehicle may or may not be assigned — irrelevant to this state. |
| `en_route_to_pickup` | Driver has started toward the pickup location. Requires an active TripAssignment. |
| `arrived_at_pickup` | Driver is at the pickup location; passenger not yet in the vehicle. |
| `passenger_onboard` | Passenger has been loaded (seatbelt/wheelchair securement, paperwork) but the vehicle has not necessarily started moving yet — a real, distinct operational moment for NEMT, where loading time is often non-trivial. |
| `en_route_to_destination` | Vehicle is actively moving toward the destination with the passenger aboard. |
| `arrived_at_destination` | Driver is at the destination; trip not yet closed out. |
| `completed` | Terminal. Trip finished successfully. |
| `cancelled` | Terminal. Trip called off before completion. |
| `no_show` | Terminal. An attempt was made (driver dispatched, typically arrived) and the passenger did not appear. |

**The "En Route" and "Arrived" ambiguity is resolved by construction, not by convention.** The backend never stores a bare `en_route` or `arrived` value — it is always the pickup-leg or destination-leg variant. The UI is free to display the shorter "En Route" / "Arrived" label (§28), but that is a presentation choice made from a known, unambiguous backend state, never the state itself.

**Completion requires arrival first.** `completed` is only reachable from `arrived_at_destination` — a trip cannot be marked complete while still `en_route_to_destination`. This guarantees every completed trip has an explicit, recorded arrival moment behind it.

## D. Should Trip have Draft? (resolved — no)

**MVP recommendation: A — create a Trip only when the minimum required data is valid.** No `draft` state.

There is no approved "Save Draft Trip" workflow, and introducing one speculatively would add a state with no defined entry/exit rules or approved UI. Current behavior — a Trip is created directly into `scheduled` with driver/vehicle simply absent — already covers "not yet assigned" without needing a separate draft concept; an unassigned `scheduled` Trip *is* the minimal, real, valid form of an incomplete-but-existing trip. If a genuine draft/multi-step trip-creation workflow is approved later, that is a new, deliberate decision, not a default.

## E. Assigned is not a Trip state (confirmed, unchanged from P1-E1-S1)

TripAssignment remains the sole source of truth for who is on a trip (ZD-051). Trip.state never encodes assignment presence. The derivation is:

```
Trip.state = scheduled AND no active TripAssignment  →  UI: "Needs Assignment"
Trip.state = scheduled AND active TripAssignment exists  →  UI: "Assigned"
Trip.state beyond scheduled (en_route_to_pickup, etc.)  →  an active TripAssignment is a precondition, not a displayed status in its own right
```

**Canonical vs. derived, explicitly:**

| Label | Canonical (stored) | Derived (computed) |
|---|---|---|
| Scheduled, En Route (either leg), Arrived (either leg), Passenger Onboard, Completed, Cancelled, No Show | ✅ Trip.state | |
| Needs Assignment | | ✅ Trip.state = scheduled + no active TripAssignment |
| Assigned | | ✅ Trip.state = scheduled + active TripAssignment |
| Running Late | | ✅ see §16/K |

## F. Trip Assignment lifecycle

TripAssignment remains append-only history, unchanged from the confirmed P1-E1-S1 model: active assignment = the row with `ended_at IS NULL`; reassignment closes the current row (`ended_at`, reason) and inserts a new one; history is never rewritten.

**Evaluated additions — recommendation is to add none as enum states:**

- **Assignment created / ended / reassigned** — already fully represented by `assigned_at`/`ended_at`/`end_reason` timestamps and row insertion. No enum needed; timestamps are cleaner (§7 principle: don't add an enum where timestamps/events are cleaner).
- **Driver acknowledgement — genuinely unresolved, flagged rather than guessed.** Recommendation: **useful but deferred, not required MVP behavior.** No approved driver workflow currently requires a driver to explicitly acknowledge an assignment before acting on it (prior "Acknowledged" references were not approved). If adopted later, it should be represented as a nullable `acknowledged_at` timestamp directly on the TripAssignment row — a fact-in-time, not a branching state — never a new enum value. **This needs explicit product confirmation before schema design treats it as required or absent.**
- **Assignment declined by driver — not designed, flagged as open.** No approved capability for a driver to decline an assignment exists. If ever added, the cleanest representation is simply ending the assignment (`ended_at`, `end_reason = 'declined_by_driver'`) rather than a distinct "declined" status — functionally indistinguishable from any other assignment closure except for who initiated it and why, which the existing `end_reason` field already captures. **Whether drivers get this capability at all is an open product question**, not an architecture gap.

## G. Trip Exception lifecycle

**States:** `open` → `resolved`. No third `dismissed` state — a raised-in-error or no-action-needed exception is simply `resolved`, with the resolution note explaining that no action was taken. Adding a distinct state for that would track a distinction the resolution note already carries.

- **Who may create:** Dispatcher, Organization Admin (any exception type). Driver may create one, but only on a trip they are actively, legitimately assigned to (consistent with the driver-assignment-scoped principle established in domain-model.md §H).
- **Who may resolve:** Dispatcher, Organization Admin only. A driver may raise an issue; only operations closes it — matching the same create-only pattern already established for driver-authored TripNotes.
- **Resolution generates an event:** yes — an informational TripEvent recording who resolved it, when, and the resolution note.
- **Does an open exception block Trip transitions?** No, not at MVP. An open exception is an attention flag, not a hard gate — e.g., an open "vehicle issue" exception does not by itself prevent marking `arrived_at_pickup`. Building per-exception-type hard-blocking rules is a real future refinement, not something approved or needed now; documented here so it isn't silently assumed either way.
- **Taxonomy:** not finalized (per instruction). Examples referenced (passenger unavailable, location issue, driver delay, vehicle issue, timing conflict, return-confirmation pending) remain illustrative, not a committed enum.

## H. Trip Event model

TripEvent is the append-only, human-readable operational timeline — not itself a lifecycle with states. Four categories, not one flat list:

| Category | Purpose | Examples (illustrative, not final) |
|---|---|---|
| **State-transition events** | Mirror every Trip.state change 1:1 | `trip_scheduled`, `en_route_to_pickup`, `arrived_at_pickup`, `passenger_onboard`, `en_route_to_destination`, `arrived_at_destination`, `trip_completed`, `trip_cancelled`, `no_show_recorded` |
| **Assignment events** | Human-readable narrative of TripAssignment changes — TripAssignment stays the canonical, queryable source of truth for "who is assigned right now"; these events exist so the timeline reads naturally without a dispatcher needing to separately query TripAssignment | `driver_assigned`, `driver_reassigned`, `assignment_ended` |
| **Informational events** | Occurrences that don't change Trip.state but have operational/audit value | `driver_called_passenger`, `exception_flagged`, `exception_resolved` |
| **System events** | Automated, non-human-triggered occurrences | `request_converted_to_trip` |

**Immutability (confirmed, unchanged from P1-E1-S1):** TripEvent is append-only for ordinary actors — no UPDATE, no DELETE, for Driver or Dispatcher. A needed correction is a new compensating event, never a rewrite of history. No exceptions carved out here.

## I. Cancellation model

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Who may cancel? | Dispatcher, Organization Admin. |
| Public requester? | Not directly — no self-service capability approved. A requester-initiated cancellation goes through operations (phone/existing channel), who perform the actual transition. |
| Driver? | **Cannot execute a cancellation.** A driver may *request* one — by raising a TripException (or a driver-visible-adjacent note) describing why — but only Dispatcher/Organization Admin perform the `→ cancelled` transition. |
| Facility user? | Not applicable — no facility accounts exist (deferred, see domain-model.md §I). |
| Source states | Any non-terminal state (`scheduled` through `arrived_at_destination`). Not from `completed` or `no_show` — already terminal. |
| What happens to the active TripAssignment? | Closed (`ended_at` set, `end_reason = 'trip_cancelled'`) — never deleted, preserved as history like any other assignment closure. |
| What event is recorded? | `trip_cancelled` TripEvent, with actor, timestamp, and the cancellation reason. |
| Reason required? | Yes — mandatory, not optional, given the audit value of knowing why a trip didn't happen. |
| Can a cancelled Trip be reopened? | No, for normal actors — `cancelled` is terminal like `completed`. A cancellation made in error is corrected only through the privileged administrative-correction path (§N/§26), with a mandatory reason and an AuditEvent — never a normal "uncancel" action in ordinary operations UI. |

## J. No-show model

**`no_show` is a Trip terminal state**, deliberately distinct from a `passenger_unavailable` TripException:

- **`passenger_unavailable` (TripException, `open`)** — an in-progress concern raised while still attempting the trip (e.g., driver has arrived and is trying to reach the passenger). This is not yet an outcome — it's a flag that something needs attention.
- **`no_show` (Trip.state, terminal)** — the deliberate, explicit decision that the attempt is over and the passenger did not travel. This is always a human decision (driver or dispatcher), never automatic or time-triggered, because the exact wait-time policy that would justify an automatic call is still unresolved (decision register ZD-020 — wait-time rules UNKNOWN).
- **Recommended flow:** `arrived_at_pickup` (or, less commonly, `en_route_to_pickup` if contact fails before arrival) → optionally an open `passenger_unavailable` exception while attempting contact → an explicit `no_show` transition, which also resolves that exception (its resolution note references the no-show outcome).
- **Source states for `no_show`:** `en_route_to_pickup` or `arrived_at_pickup` only — not `scheduled` (too early; that's a cancellation, not a no-show, since no attempt was made) and not later legs (the passenger is, by definition, already aboard by then).

This distinction matters beyond the state model itself: NEMT operations need `no_show` as an unambiguous, queryable, billing-relevant outcome, separate from an ordinary cancellation — even though billing itself is deferred (domain-model.md §P), the state model should not need to be redesigned when it arrives.

## K. UI label → domain concept map

| UI label | Domain home | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Requested | TransportationRequest (`pending`) | |
| Scheduled | Trip (`scheduled`) | |
| Needs Assignment | **Derived** | `scheduled` + no active TripAssignment |
| Assigned | **Derived** | `scheduled` + active TripAssignment |
| En Route | Trip, but **ambiguous as written** | Backend is always `en_route_to_pickup` or `en_route_to_destination` — never a bare value |
| Arrived | Trip, but **ambiguous as written** | Backend is always `arrived_at_pickup` or `arrived_at_destination` |
| Passenger Onboard | Trip (`passenger_onboard`) | |
| Completed | Trip (`completed`) | |
| Running Late | **Derived** (§16) | Computed from scheduled time vs. now; escalates to a TripException only if someone needs to act on or record the delay — never a Trip state or stored field |
| Pending Confirmation | TransportationRequest (`pending`) **or** an unfulfilled return leg | Not a Trip state. If used for "return trip not yet arranged," that's simply the absence of a second Trip row against the request — not a state on anything |
| Available / On Trip / Break / Unavailable | **Driver availability — not Trip lifecycle at all** | See §L. A separate, currently undesigned concept |

No label above is allowed to mean two different things depending on screen — each row is a single, fixed home.

## L. Driver availability is not Trip lifecycle

`Available`, `On Trip`, `Break`, `Unavailable` describe a **Driver's own operational availability**, not any Trip's state. They belong nowhere in the Trip, TripAssignment, TransportationRequest, or TripException models defined above, and must never be derived from or stored as a Trip field.

This document does **not** design that concept — a driver scheduling/shift/availability system is out of scope here per the explicit instruction not to fully model it unless required for *lifecycle clarity*, and it is not required for the clarity of the five lifecycles above. Flagged as a deferred concept (§S) for its own future work item.

## M. Request status is not Trip status

Public-facing wording driven by TransportationRequest.state must never imply anything about driver assignment, vehicle confirmation, or a locked ride time — those facts live on Trip/TripAssignment, which the public surface does not expose (domain-model.md §M — Public has no read access to Trip or TripAssignment).

| Request state | Permitted public-facing implication | Forbidden implication |
|---|---|---|
| `pending` | Received / under review | "Confirmed," any driver/vehicle/time detail |
| `accepted` | Accepted for scheduling | A specific driver, vehicle, or locked pickup time — those are Trip/Assignment facts, not Request facts |
| `declined` | Unable to accommodate (exact copy is a content decision, deferred) | — |
| `cancelled` | Cancelled | — |

**"Ride Confirmed" is never permitted copy for a Request state alone**, at any point — that phrase describes a Trip/Assignment fact, and Request never reaches into that layer.

## N. Actor / transition permission matrix

Actors: Public unauthenticated requester, Authenticated requester (future), Organization Admin, Dispatcher, Driver, Platform Admin, System/trusted server.

### TransportationRequest transitions

| Transition | Allowed actor | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| (create) → `pending` | Public (controlled path only), Dispatcher, Org Admin | See domain-model.md §L public-intake boundary |
| `pending` → `accepted` | System | Triggered by Trip creation, not a discretionary action |
| `pending` → `declined` | Dispatcher, Org Admin | |
| `pending` → `cancelled` | Dispatcher, Org Admin | Requester-initiated, but staff-executed (§B) |

### Trip transitions

| Transition | Allowed actor | Required relationship | Required current state | TripEvent? | AuditEvent? | Assignment required? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| (create) → `scheduled` | Dispatcher, Org Admin | Membership in target org | — | `trip_scheduled` | No (routine) | No |
| `scheduled` → `en_route_to_pickup` | Driver | Active TripAssignment belongs to this driver | `scheduled` | `en_route_to_pickup` | No | Yes |
| `en_route_to_pickup` → `arrived_at_pickup` | Driver | Same as above | `en_route_to_pickup` | `arrived_at_pickup` | No | Yes |
| `arrived_at_pickup` → `passenger_onboard` | Driver | Same as above | `arrived_at_pickup` | `passenger_onboard` | No | Yes |
| `passenger_onboard` → `en_route_to_destination` | Driver | Same as above | `passenger_onboard` | `en_route_to_destination` | No | Yes |
| `en_route_to_destination` → `arrived_at_destination` | Driver | Same as above | `en_route_to_destination` | `arrived_at_destination` | No | Yes |
| `arrived_at_destination` → `completed` | Driver | Same as above | `arrived_at_destination` | `trip_completed` | No (routine) | Yes |
| any non-terminal → `cancelled` | Dispatcher, Org Admin | Membership in target org | not already terminal | `trip_cancelled` | Yes (mutation of an in-flight trip) | No |
| `en_route_to_pickup` or `arrived_at_pickup` → `no_show` | Dispatcher, Org Admin, or Driver (own assignment) | Membership or active assignment | as listed | `no_show_recorded` | Yes | Yes |
| any terminal → anything | **Nobody**, via normal transition | — | — | — | — | — |
| privileged correction of any state | Platform Admin (verified PlatformAdminGrant) | See §26 | any | compensating event | Yes, mandatory | — |

### TripAssignment transitions

| Transition | Allowed actor | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| (create) — initial assignment | Dispatcher, Org Admin | |
| close current + create new — reassignment | Dispatcher, Org Admin | Atomic: close-then-insert in one transaction |
| close current, no replacement — unassign | Dispatcher, Org Admin | Trip reverts to "Needs Assignment" (derived) |
| Driver: any write | **Never** | Driver has read-only access to their own assignment (domain-model.md §17) |

### TripException transitions

| Transition | Allowed actor | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| (create) → `open` | Dispatcher, Org Admin (any type); Driver (own assigned trip only) | |
| `open` → `resolved` | Dispatcher, Org Admin only | Driver cannot resolve, even their own |

## O. RLS / security transition rules

**The controlled transition boundary (confirmed as the required future mutation pattern — not implemented in this phase):**

```
Driver action
  → controlled transition boundary (future RPC / trusted server function)
  → verify auth user
  → verify active membership
  → verify linked Driver
  → verify active TripAssignment
  → verify organization consistency (Trip.organization_id = Assignment.organization_id = Driver.organization_id)
  → verify current Trip state
  → verify requested transition is allowed from that state
  → update Trip state
  → append TripEvent
  → append AuditEvent where appropriate
  → commit atomically
```

No future Driver client is ever granted a generic `UPDATE trips SET state = <value>` capability. A driver requests a specific, named transition; the boundary validates every precondition above before anything is written. Operations staff go through an equivalent boundary with the actor checks appropriate to their role — operations does not get unlimited lifecycle mutation either (§10): normal lifecycle transitions (schedule, assign, cancel, mark no-show, resolve exception) are available to Dispatcher/Org Admin; **administrative correction** (rewriting a state that was recorded in error) is a categorically different, privileged action requiring elevated verification, a mandatory reason, and an AuditEvent — never available through the same button as a normal transition.

**Driver RLS requirement, stated precisely (per instruction §25):** a Driver may perform a lifecycle transition only when *all* of the following hold simultaneously:
- the authenticated user maps to a Driver record;
- that Driver belongs to the same organization as the Trip;
- the driver's organization Membership is active where membership is otherwise required;
- an active TripAssignment (`ended_at IS NULL`) exists and belongs to that Driver;
- `TripAssignment.organization_id = Trip.organization_id` (composite-FK-backed, per domain-model.md §N);
- the requested transition is a legal edge from the Trip's current state.

**A driver must never gain any right merely from knowing a Trip ID.** Every check above is independent of whether the ID is known — guessing or being told a UUID grants nothing without the relationship chain above holding.

## P. Platform Admin correction principle

Platform Admin lifecycle intervention exists for genuine correction of mistakes, not routine operation. Any privileged correction must:
- verify a valid PlatformAdminGrant (domain-model.md §B entity 4) — never inferred from any other role;
- record a mandatory reason;
- create an AuditEvent;
- preserve prior state history (TripEvent/TripAssignment rows are never deleted or rewritten to make a correction look like it never happened);
- never silently delete operational evidence — a correction is itself a new, visible fact in the record, not an erasure of the old one.

## Q. Atomic mutation requirement

Every state-changing lifecycle mutation — Trip.state update, its corresponding TripEvent insert, and any required AuditEvent — must occur in a single database transaction. The system must never be observed in a state where the Trip moved but no event exists, or an event exists describing a transition that didn't actually apply. The likely future implementation is a PostgreSQL function (Supabase RPC) or an equivalent trusted server-side transaction wrapping all three writes — not implemented in this phase.

## R. Concurrency / idempotency strategy

Recommended, simplest-robust-for-MVP approach — no over-engineering:

| Race condition | Control |
|---|---|
| Dispatcher cancels while driver marks arrival, simultaneously | **Expected-current-state validation** inside the transition function, combined with row-level locking (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`) on the Trip row for the duration of the transaction — whichever request's transaction commits first wins; the second is rejected because the Trip is no longer in the state its request assumed |
| Two operations users attempt reassignment simultaneously | The future **partial unique index** (one active TripAssignment per trip, `ended_at IS NULL`) makes a second concurrent "insert new active assignment without closing the current one" fail at the constraint level; the correct atomic operation closes-then-inserts within one locked transaction |
| Driver retries the same transition (poor connectivity) | **Treat "requested transition target already equals current state" as an idempotent no-op success**, not an error — distinct from "invalid transition from the wrong state," which still errors. This covers duplicate submissions and double-taps without needing a client-generated idempotency key |
| Two browser requests submit the same transition | Same no-op handling as above |

**Explicitly not adopted at MVP:** client-supplied idempotency keys (the no-op-on-matching-state rule covers the realistic retry cases without the added protocol complexity) and `updated_at`/version optimistic-concurrency columns (redundant given row-level locking plus expected-current-state validation already prevent lost updates). Both are documented here as the next escalation if the simpler approach proves insufficient in practice — not built preemptively.

## S. Adversarial transition test matrix

Restated as the mandatory future test suite for lifecycle enforcement, alongside the RLS test matrix in domain-model.md §O:

| Test | Scenario | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| A | `scheduled → en_route_to_pickup`, by the assigned Driver | ALLOW |
| B | `scheduled → completed`, by a Driver | DENY |
| C | `en_route_to_pickup → arrived_at_pickup`, by the assigned Driver | ALLOW |
| D | Org A Driver attempts a transition on an Org B Trip | DENY |
| E | Org A Driver attempts a transition on another Org A Driver's Trip | DENY |
| F | Driver attempts a transition after their assignment ended/was reassigned | DENY |
| G | `cancelled → en_route_to_pickup`, by a normal Driver | DENY |
| H | `completed → arrived_at_destination`, by a normal Driver | DENY |
| I | Driver repeats an identical transition already applied (retry) | Idempotent no-op success, not an error |
| J | Operations cancels an active Trip | Controlled transition + `trip_cancelled` event + TripAssignment closed |
| K | Two simultaneous reassignment attempts on the same Trip | At most one active TripAssignment results |
| L | Direct Supabase REST call attempting a state mutation, bypassing the UI | Same authorization result as through the application |
| M | Driver attempts to set an arbitrary/unlisted state value | DENY |
| N | Driver creates an operational event without a corresponding permitted state transition | DENY |
| O | User with an inactive Membership attempts any transition | DENY |

## Deferred lifecycle concepts

- Driver acknowledgement of assignment (recommended: useful-but-deferred; representation if adopted: `acknowledged_at` timestamp) — **needs product confirmation**.
- Driver decline-assignment capability — not designed; **needs product confirmation** whether it exists at all.
- Exact wait-time / no-show timing policy (still ZD-020, UNKNOWN) — doesn't block the state model, but blocks giving drivers/dispatchers a concrete "when are you allowed to mark no-show" rule.
- TripException severity/taxonomy beyond illustrative examples.
- Driver availability/shift system (§L) — a separate future concept, not designed here.
- Requester self-service cancellation or status visibility.
- Exact cancellation-reason taxonomy (free text vs. fixed categories).
- Exact public-facing copy for each Request state (a content decision, not architecture).
- Client-supplied idempotency keys and optimistic-concurrency versioning (§R) — deferred unless the simpler approach proves insufficient.
- Billing-relevant implications of `no_show` vs. `cancelled` (billing itself remains fully deferred per domain-model.md §P).

## Open product questions

1. Is driver acknowledgement of assignment required for MVP, or genuinely deferred? (§F)
2. Do drivers get any assignment-decline capability, ever? (§F)
3. Is a lightweight `leg` label (`outbound` / `return` / `unspecified`) on Trip wanted for return-trip UI grouping, or is shared `request_id` alone sufficient? (§I open item, domain-model.md §20 topic)
4. Exact public-facing copy for each Request state (§M) — a copywriting decision, not blocking architecture.
5. Exact cancellation-reason taxonomy — free text at MVP is assumed sufficient; confirm.

None of the above block the Lifecycle Security Gate below — each is either a UX/copy decision or an additive feature whose absence doesn't weaken enforcement of what's already defined.

## Return transportation model

Outbound and return transportation are **separate Trip rows**, never one Trip that changes direction. Both link back to the same TransportationRequest via `request_id` — no new relational entity is introduced.

- **Grouping:** `WHERE request_id = ?` is sufficient to find every Trip belonging to one request. A lightweight, optional `leg` label (`outbound` | `return` | `unspecified`) on Trip is recommended for display convenience (avoids inferring direction from timing alone) — flagged above as needing confirmation rather than assumed.
- **Independent timing:** the two Trips are not required to share identical lifecycle timing. "Outbound completed, return pickup time unknown" is simply: one Trip row in `completed`, and the return Trip **does not exist yet** — it is created later, as a second, ordinary act of Trip creation against the same request, once return details are confirmed. There is no "pending return" Trip state to design; a not-yet-arranged return is the *absence* of a second Trip row, not a state on anything.
- **"Return: not sure yet" at request time** never causes a placeholder Trip to be created — it's simply information captured on the request (already covered by TransportationRequest fields, domain-model.md §B), resolved later by operations deciding whether/when to create the second Trip.

---

## Security gate

**LIFECYCLE SECURITY GATE — READY**

Every requirement is met: TransportationRequest lifecycle is defined (§B, 4 states); Trip lifecycle is defined (§C, 9 unambiguous states with resolved En Route/Arrived ambiguity); TripAssignment lifecycle is defined (§F, timestamp-based, no enum, with acknowledgement/decline explicitly flagged rather than silently assumed); TripException lifecycle is defined (§G, open/resolved); terminal states are defined for every entity (`accepted`/`declined`/`cancelled` for Request; `completed`/`cancelled`/`no_show` for Trip); actor transition permissions are defined (§N); driver transition constraints are defined precisely enough to implement RLS from directly (§O); UI-derived statuses are fully separated from canonical state (§E/§K — nothing stored merely because a screen needed a label); cancellation behavior is defined (§I); no-show behavior is defined and distinguished from the related exception (§J); the atomic-transition requirement is stated (§Q); a concurrency strategy is recommended without over-engineering (§R); and the adversarial test matrix is defined (§S).

The five open questions are genuinely non-blocking: driver acknowledgement/decline are additive UX decisions whose absence doesn't weaken any enforcement already specified; the `leg` field is a display convenience; cancellation-reason taxonomy and request-state copy are content decisions. None of them prevent secure transition enforcement for the model as defined.
